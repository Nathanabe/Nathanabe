### Backend Engineer | API Architect | Infrastructure Builder

I build backend systems that are structured, secure, and scalable.

Currently engineering:

### 🧠 Dustid — Intelligent Gifting Infrastructure
> A smart system enabling secure gifting without exposing physical addresses.  
Backend architecture, JWT/OAuth authentication, Shopify Checkout UI extensions, and API orchestration.

### 📚 CourseMigo — Learning Management API
> Full-featured backend for student & instructor workflows.  
Role-based authentication, clean MVC architecture, RESTful APIs, and scalable database modeling.

I turn concepts into production-ready systems — from API design to deployment.

## What I Do

- Design clean backend architectures (MVC)
- Build scalable REST APIs with Node.js + Express
- Implement secure authentication systems (JWT, OAuth)
- Integrate third-party platforms (Shopify, Webhooks, Extensions)
- Structure codebases for long-term maintainability
- Build MVPs with production-quality systems

## Current Focus

- Infrastructure-level backend engineering
- Secure API design & token lifecycle management
- Shopify Checkout Extensions
- WooCommerce plugin development (PHP)
- System design thinking

Engineering Philosophy: clarity over complexity. Structure over chaos. Systems over scripts.

Open to infrastructure-heavy backend challenges.
